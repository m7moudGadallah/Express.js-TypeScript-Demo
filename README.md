# Express.js, TypeScript Demo

This is a personal practice project for experimenting with Express.js and TypeScript.

> Please note that this demo **doesn't use a database**. Instead, it loads sample data from a JSON file when the server starts. The project includes a model class that performs CRUD operations on this data.

## Usage

- Use your preferred API client (e.g., Postman, curl) to interact with the API.
- Alternatively, you can use the REST Client extension in Visual Studio Code to test the API directly from the provided [posts.http](./http/posts.http) file. The rest.http file contains URLs to all endpoints, making it convenient to make requests and test your API.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/posts` - Get all posts
- `GET /api/posts/:id` - Get a single post
- `POST /api/posts` - Create a new post
- `PATCH /api/posts/:id` - Update a post
- `DELETE /api/posts/:id` - Delete a post
